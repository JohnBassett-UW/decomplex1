Title: decomplex1, a package for sample demultiplexing
Version: 0.1.0
Author: John Bassett & Chris Mcginnis
Maintainer: John Bassett <jbassett@fredhutch.org>
Description: decomplex1 is designed specifically to demultiplex hashed nuclei originating 
    from frozen tumor samples. The issue with frozen tumors is that large amount of 
    contaminating debris cause high background in hashing counts. decomplex1 features      a modified thresholding process that more accurately handles noisy count matrices.
